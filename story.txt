--------
you are a small time hacker at college looking up the answers
to your tests through your colleges database.

you decide to go one step further and change your history grade from
a 65% to an 84%

while you succeeded, youre still an amateur and left some record of yourself
on the machine that [some name] professor found.

[some name] isnt mad about it, since its not directly his money, and
in fact he was looking for hackers anyway

he introduces you to his secret group of (2-4) people trying to take out
[big company] and recruits you for his team (one or more of these people
work at the [big company])

you start your first mission, they finally have the number of people to do it.

you come up on the nearby datacenter of the [big company] and leak a
tiny thing about [big company].

one person in your group gets caught, and dissapears, scaring the team,
but now youve gone too far in and cant back out
